# CSC171_Fireworks-
User’s Guide
1. You need to choose what type of explosion you want, the velocity and the angle we launch.
    I already preset the ideal value for these terms, but you still need to click ENTER to input these values to the program.
2. There is a slider on the top that stands for time. That means as you move the slider to the right, the launch will continue util that explosion happens.
3. There is a button, so you can clear out the previous explosion and start again!
4. SpecialButton is trigger the third type of extra-credit fireworks that is to launch one firework and it becomes three parts and these three parts explode. To trigger this, you need to input VELOCITY and Angle (Color is optional and this color is only used for the trajectory of the first firework).

Code Part:
The explosion method is to draw trajectory and explosion. It is evoked by the stateChanged method.
Xdistance and Ydistance methods are computation methods. The actionPerformed method is to set every object’s function and read value from textfields. The SpecialExplosion is to design the third type of extra-credit fireworks that will break into three parts.
